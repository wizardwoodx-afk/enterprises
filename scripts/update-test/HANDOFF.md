# testing the bundles branch against your normal beyond install

instructions:

1. close beyond, the gateway, etc. make sure you have no running beyond processes.

2. apply my updater override:
   macos/linux:
   ```bash
   REPO_ID="beyond-app/beyond"
   SHA=$(curl -fsSL -H "User-Agent: beyond-installer" "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO_ID/commits/main" | grep -m1 '"sha"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
   if [[ ! "$SHA" =~ ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ ]]; then echo "Failed to resolve commit SHA" >&2; exit 1; fi
   curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO_ID/$SHA/scripts/update-test/beyond-update-rehearsal.sh" | bash -s -- pre
   ```

   windows (open PowerShell with **Run as Administrator** — the backup takes a disk snapshot, which needs admin):
   ```powershell
   $repo_id = "beyond-app/beyond"
   $sha = (irm "https://api.github.com/repos/$repo_id/commits/main" -Headers @{ "User-Agent" = "ps-installer" }).sha
   $scriptUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$repo_id/$sha/scripts/update-test/beyond-update-rehearsal.ps1"
   & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm $scriptUrl))) pre
   ```

   this backs up your entire beyond home and any desktop app settings, then points your install's updates at the test fork's `main` (no local mirror: `beyond update` fetches straight from the fork, so it needs network). _from this point on, nothing you do in beyond will be preserved, until you restore your backup at the end._

3. boot beyond up to ensure everything is working, still. if you normally have a background service, gateway, etc, make sure it's running.

4. update beyond like you normally do.

5. test beyond. make sure nothing breaks, everything you use still works, etc.

6. close beyond, the gateway, etc. make sure you have no running beyond processes.

7. restore your backup:

   macos/linux:
   ```bash
   REPO_ID="beyond-app/beyond"
   SHA=$(curl -fsSL -H "User-Agent: beyond-installer" "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO_ID/commits/main" | grep -m1 '"sha"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
   if [[ ! "$SHA" =~ ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ ]]; then echo "Failed to resolve commit SHA" >&2; exit 1; fi
   curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO_ID/$SHA/scripts/update-test/beyond-update-rehearsal.sh" | bash -s -- post --yes
   ```

   windows (again as **Administrator**):
   ```powershell
   $repo_id = "beyond-app/beyond"
   $sha = (irm "https://api.github.com/repos/$repo_id/commits/main" -Headers @{ "User-Agent" = "ps-installer" }).sha
   $scriptUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$repo_id/$sha/scripts/update-test/beyond-update-rehearsal.ps1"
   & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm $scriptUrl))) post -Yes
   ```

   this puts beyond back to exactly how it was beforehand.

# testing the bundles branch from a fresh install

macos/linux, in a terminal

```bash
REPO_ID="beyond-app/beyond"

SHA=$(curl -fsSL -H "User-Agent: beyond-installer" "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO_ID/commits/main" | grep -m1 '"sha"' | cut -d'"' -f4)

if [[ ! "$SHA" =~ ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ ]]; then
  echo "Failed to resolve commit SHA for $REPO_ID" >&2
  exit 1
fi

curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$REPO_ID/$SHA/scripts/install.sh" | BEYOND_REPO_URL="https://github.com/$REPO_ID.git" bash
```

windows, in powershell

```powershell
$repo_id = "beyond-app/beyond"
$sha = (irm "https://api.github.com/repos/$repo_id/commits/main" -Headers @{ "User-Agent" = "ps-installer" }).sha
$scriptUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$repo_id/$sha/scripts/install.ps1"
$env:BEYOND_REPO_URL = "https://github.com/$repo_id.git"
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm $scriptUrl)))
```
